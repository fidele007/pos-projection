This is a Java project for implementing POS-Tagging on a low-resource language via cross-lingual projection (English-Malagasy).

The code also contains a few functions for filtering and preparing tagged dataset for training a POS-Tagger with [BiLSTM-Debias](https://github.com/fidele007/BiLSTM-Debias) algorithm.
